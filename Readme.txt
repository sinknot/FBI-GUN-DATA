Dataset:FBI-Guns-Dataset

##Investigation and dataset overview

The dataset used in this notebook is the FBI Gun Datasets, which include two dataset, one is a number of background checks from FBI upon any gun purchases, the other one is a Census Data including various census related variables.

The FBI Gun data includes a range of different background check types, to name a few, 'permit', 'permit recheck', 'handgun', 'long gun', 'multiple'(purchasing more than one gun per background check). For each month, each state, there's a data point consisting all the above mentioned variables. Among all the variables, only the 'totals' variable will be used here, which means the total number of all the various background checks in each state and month.


##Summary of Exploratory Findings
Looking into the two datasets, we started to set the main focal points about the data, after cleaning the data we digged deeper by creating multiple correlations to find out the major backeground check associated with gun sales and found that there were two main checks under the veterans and households. also we tried to find if there is a correlation between ethnic group and gun registeration but it was a weak relation.using the multistage analysis we deduced the growth rates in weapon registrations.and also we serached if there is a season for gun sales and found a seasonal pattern.

##Key Insights Included in the Presentation
For the presentation, We worked on the a census and the gun data. we presented the census data associated with gun regestration to show the groups with the highest gun registartion and also to show what ethnic group. 
Then we started investigating the states with the highest and lowest to deduced the most armed state,illinois, and from that point we thought about  the highest times of gun sales and found out gun sales have a significant boost in the end of each year.
